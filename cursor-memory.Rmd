- **Why**: React requires special characters to be escaped to prevent XML parsing issues
- **Where**: Found in text content within JSX components
- **Learning**: 
  1. Always review ESLint errors in development before deploying
  2. Pay attention to special characters in text content
  3. Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to catch these issues early
  4. Remember that production builds are often stricter than development

## Debugging Steps:
1. Read the full error message carefully
2. Identify the specific files and line numbers
3. Look for patterns in the errors
4. Consider both quick fixes and proper long-term solutions

## Prevention Strategies:
1. Run `next build` locally before deploying
